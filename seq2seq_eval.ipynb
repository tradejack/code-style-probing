For an example dedicated client take a look at: https://github.com/demisto/demisto-py.  Requests must include API-key that can be generated in the Demisto web client under 'Settings' -> 'Integrations' -> 'API keys'   Optimistic Locking and Versioning\\\\:  When using Demisto REST API, you will need to make sure to work on the latest version of the item (incident, entry, etc.), otherwise, you will get a DB version error (which not allow you to override a newer item). In addition, you can pass'version\\\\: -1' to force data override (make sure that other users data might be lost).  Assume that Alice and Bob both read the same data from Demisto server, then they both changed the data, and then both tried to write the new versions back to the server. Whose changes should be saved? Aliceâ€™s? Bobâ€™s? To solve this, each data item in Demisto has a numeric incremental version. If Alice saved an item with version 4 and Bob trying to save the same item with version 3, Demisto will rollback Bob request and returns a DB version conflict error. Bob will need to get the latest item and work on it so Alice work will not get lost.

      "    ### Authorization  The Looker API uses Looker **API3** credentials for authorization and access control. Looker admins can create API3 credentials on Looker's **Admin/Users** page. Pass API3 credentials to the **/login** endpoint to obtain a temporary access_token. Include that access_token in the Authorization header of Looker API requests. For details, see [Looker API Authorization](https://looker.com/docs/r/api/authorization)  ### Client SDKs  The Looker API is a RESTful system that should be usable by any programming language capable of making HTTPS requests. Client SDKs for a variety of programming languages can be generated from the Looker API's Swagger JSON metadata to streamline use of the Looker API in your applications. A client SDK for Ruby is available as an example. For more information, see [Looker API Client SDKs](https://looker.com/docs/r/api/client_sdks)  ### Try It Out!  The 'api-docs' page served by the Looker instance includes 'Try It Out!' buttons for each API method. After logging in with API3 credentials, you can use the \"Try It Out!\" buttons to call the API directly from the documentation page to interactively explore API features and responses.  ### Versioning  Future releases of Looker will expand this API release-by-release to securely expose more and more of the core power of Looker to API client applications. API endpoints marked as \"beta\" may receive breaking changes without warning. Stable (non-beta) API endpoints should not receive breaking changes in future releases. For more information, see [Looker API Versioning](https://looker.com/docs/r/api/versioning) \n",

SequenceIQ's Cloudbreak is a RESTful application development platform with the goal of helping developers to build solutions for deploying Hadoop YARN clusters in different environments. Once it is deployed in your favourite servlet container it exposes a REST API allowing to span up Hadoop clusters of arbitary sizes and cloud providers. Provisioning Hadoop has never been easier.
